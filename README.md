# weather-app

First project using APIs. 
Used a weather API to pull data from a search input. The data was then disected and a new class was made using only the data I wanted to display on site.
Used async and await functions as apposed to then() and promise returns.

Did very basic error catching, and should look deeper into how to implement proper error catching.
Performed very basic css, as this project seems like a smaller one to get the basics of APIs.
